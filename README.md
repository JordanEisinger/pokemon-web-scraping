## What is "web scraping"?

* From **Google**:
  * *Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website...web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.*
  
## Why is it important?

* By using web scraping techniques, one can quickly and easily extract data from various sources without the need of copying and pasting data by hand.

## Goal of Project

* The goal of this project is to learn how to write web scraping scripts using Python.

* To make things fun, we will use different **Pokemon** websites as HTML data sources for use with the Python web scraping modules and libraries.

* The idea for this project came from the following [blog post.](https://xandermadsen.com/2020/09/07/pokemon-data-analysis-part-1-scraping-a-dataset-from-bulbapedia/)
